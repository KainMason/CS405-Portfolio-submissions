## 🧾 Portfolio Journal Reflection

### Reflection
CS-405 has been one of the most eye-opening courses I’ve taken because it changed how I think about writing code. Before this class, I focused mainly on functionality and performance. Now, I automatically think about security—how data is stored, how inputs are validated, and how authentication is handled. I learned that a secure program isn’t just one that works; it’s one that resists attacks and protects users even when things go wrong.

The most valuable lesson was adopting a **defense-in-depth** mindset. Instead of relying on one safeguard, I now look for ways to layer protection—input validation, encryption, strong authentication, and error handling that doesn’t leak information. Using static analysis tools like **Cppcheck** and dependency scanners also taught me how automation fits into DevSecOps pipelines to catch vulnerabilities before deployment.

Completing both major projects reinforced how security and usability have to coexist. In the **Green Pace Security Policy**, I built policies that focus on prevention through secure coding standards. In **Project Two**, I demonstrated how automated testing identifies and mitigates real weaknesses. Together, they gave me hands-on experience linking theoretical principles with practical application.

This course made me more confident in approaching software development from a secure-by-design perspective. Whether I’m building a full-stack web app, analyzing data systems, or contributing to a larger engineering project, I’ll carry forward the habit of thinking like an attacker—and coding like a defender.
